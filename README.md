# Git-Log

## What's This About?

I've always been terrible at keeping track of my accomplishments at work. Everyone says you should maintain a log of what you've done for when you need to update your CV or go for a promotion, but I never actually do it. Then I realized that 99% of my work is already tracked on GitHub through my commits and pull requests. So why not just use that data?

This project pulls your GitHub commit and PR history using the GitHub REST API and uses LLMs to turn it into a readable summary of everything you've worked on. It's basically an automated way to document your accomplishments without having to remember to write them down. Plus, knowing that this tool exists has actually inspired me to write better commit messages and create higher quality PRs, since garbage in means garbage out.

## Features

- Automatically fetches commit and PR history from GitHub
- Uses LLMs to generate professional summaries
- Exports accomplishments in multiple formats
- Helps maintain an ongoing career portfolio
